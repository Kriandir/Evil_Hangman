##Disclaimer:
I didn't manage three features correctly:
1. I didn't manage to implement evil gameplay completely (only removes words if letter is in word)
2. I didn't manage to sort my highscore list in time
3. I didn't manage to implement save rotation in time

Im sorry I didn't manage to pull these off. I couldnt figure out  how to properly implement evil gameplay,
that made me anxious to program and made me waste time I didn't have.

## Features:


* option to set game mode to devil or angel mode
